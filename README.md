## Hi! I'm glad you're here!

This project shows you how to get started using Observatory! For this to work, you'll need:

- A **Windows PC** with **Open GL 3.3** support. 
  - *Practically speaking, the only reason why your system wouldn't support OpenGL 3.3 is if you are on a Virtual Machine.*
- **Visual Studio** (I wrote these examples using VS22 Community).
- A very basic knowledge of **C#**.
- A good attitude!

## Examples Projects

This repository contains 3 separate solutions that demonstrate different aspects of utilizing Observatory:

- **Importing**: Shows you how to make "Hello World"-style projects using both the .NET Framework and .NET6 versions, for both the NuGet packages and the stand-alone assemblies.
- **Threading**: Shows you how to structure tiny programs to launch an Observatory plot in the most common ways, e.g. from a console app or from a Windows Forms/WPF window.
- **Demos**: *The good stuff*! This gives examples of how to use the most useful and common features of Observatory to start creating your own beautiful, interactive plots!
