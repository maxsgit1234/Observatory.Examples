### *Observatory is a free .NET library that lets you create beautiful, interactive plots.*

With Observatory, you create and launch visualizations directly in .NET via the API:

```
// C#
using ObservatoryLib;

...

Plot3d plot = new Plot3d();
plot.Drawing.AddPoints(...);
plot.Display();
```

Observatory has tools for visualizing numerical data in a variety of ways: 

- Scatter plots

- Histograms 

- Heat maps

- Images

- Mathematical functions

- ...and more.

I've done my best to make it super easy to launch a basic plot, but there are also more advanced features that give you a great deal of flexibility to customize your plotting environments.
